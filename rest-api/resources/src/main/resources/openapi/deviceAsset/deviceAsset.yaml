    assetDescription:
      description: |
        An **Asset**, as defined in Kura, is a logical representation of a field device, described by a list of **Channels**.
        The Asset uses a specific Driver instance to communicate with the underlying device and it models a generic device resource as a Channel.
        A register in a PLC or a GATT Characteristic in a Bluetooth device are examples of Channels.
        In this way, each Asset has multiple Channels for reading and writing data from/to an Industrial Device.
